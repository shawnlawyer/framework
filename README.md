# Sequode PHP Sequencing Framework 

Sequode PHP Sequencing Framework is a web application framework for process creation and management in PHP. In the current state, the tool allows you to arrange PHP SPL code elements into processes without having to write the actual code.

The sequencing programming logic is not a code replacement. The tool abstracts the code elements into simple visual components and allows you to create software visually by arraging the visual elements on a stage or programmatically via a REST API.
